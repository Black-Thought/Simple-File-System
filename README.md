# Simple File System (SFS)

A lightweight, educational implementation of a **simple file system** written in **C++**, operating on a **virtual disk** stored as a regular file.  
This project demonstrates how a file system works internally — including **superblocks, inodes, block management, mounting, and data read/write operations** — all simulated at the user level.

---
## Overview

The **Simple File System (SFS)** simulates a real file system inside a **virtual disk image** (`disk0.img`) divided into fixed-size 4KB blocks.  
It provides a complete environment to **format**, **mount**, **create**, **read**, **write**, and **remove** files — just like a real operating system.

This project was built to help understand how data is organized and managed at the file system level.

## Architecture

User Commands (Shell)
↓
File System Layer (fs.cpp)
↓
Disk Interface Layer (disk.cpp)
↓
Virtual Disk File (disk0.img)

| Layer | Description | Files |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Disk Layer** | Simulates physical disk operations (block read/write) | `include/sfs/disk.h`, `src/library/disk.cpp` |
| **File System Layer** | Implements file management, metadata, and allocation logic | `include/sfs/fs.h`, `src/library/fs.cpp` |
| **Shell Interface** | Command-line interface for interaction | `src/shell/sfssh.cpp` |
| **Visualization** | Flask + D3.js web UI for visualizing disk layout | `visualize_web.py`, `templates/index.html` |

---

## Disk Layout

Each disk image is divided into 4KB blocks.  
The layout of blocks inside the virtual disk is as follows:

+-----------+-------------------+------------------+

| Block 0   | Blocks 1..N       | Remaining Blocks |

| Superblock| Inode Blocks      | Data Blocks      |

+-----------+-------------------+------------------+

| Section | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Superblock (Block 0)** | Stores overall file system metadata |
| **Inode Blocks** | Contain file metadata structures (10% of total blocks) |
| **Data Blocks** | Store actual file content |

---

## Core Structures

### SuperBlock

struct SuperBlock {
  uint32_t MagicNumber;  // Unique FS identifier
  uint32_t Blocks;       // Total number of blocks
  uint32_t InodeBlocks;  // Number of blocks reserved for inodes
  uint32_t Inodes;       // Total number of inodes
};

### Inode

```cpp
struct Inode {
  uint32_t Valid;           // 1 if the inode is in use
  uint32_t Size;            // File size in bytes
  uint32_t Direct[5];       // Direct data block pointers
  uint32_t Indirect;        // Pointer to indirect block
};
```

### IndirectBlock

```cpp
struct IndirectBlock {
  uint32_t Pointers[1024];  // 1024 * 4B = 4KB block of pointers
};
```

Each file = one inode.
Supports **5 direct** + **1 indirect** block pointers (→ up to ~4 MB per file).

## Build & Run

### Prerequisites

* Linux environment
* GCC / Clang (C++11+)
* Python 3 (for visualization)
* `make` build tool

| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `format`                            | Create a new empty file system on the disk                        |
| `mount`                             | Mount an existing file system                                     |
| `debug`                             | Print the structure of the file system (superblock, inodes, etc.) |
| `create`                            | Create a new file (allocates a free inode)                        |
